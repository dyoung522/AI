# Explore Subagents

Using 5 explore subagents, analyze this codebase to help me communicate more effectively with you in future prompts. I want you to:

1. **Scan the project structure** - Look through all directories, modules, and files to understand the architecture.
2. **Identify key terminology** including:
   - Domain-specific terms unique to this project
   - Custom class names, function names, and module names that I should reference by their exact names
   - Any internal naming conventions or patterns (e.g., if handlers are called "processors", services called "managers", etc.)
   - Abbreviations or acronyms used in the code and what they mean
   - Key abstractions or concepts the codebase is built around

3. **Map out the agent/sub-agent architecture** (if applicable):
   - What are the different agents or components called?
   - How do they interact?
   - What terminology does the code use to describe their relationships?

4. **Note any project-specific jargon** in comments, docstrings, or documentation files.
5. **Create a glossary** formatted as:
   - Term → What it means → When I should use it in prompts to you

Focus on terms that would help me give you precise instructions. For example, if I should say "create a new Handler" rather than "create a new processor" because that's what this codebase calls them, I need to know that.

Output a reference document I can keep and use when prompting you about this codebase.
